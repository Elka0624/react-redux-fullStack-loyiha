# ajax-query README

## Note

This tool will work only if it has a api supporting it from a web-server.

It calls URLS to Login, run Queries, get table data & trigger exports

For now, this works only within my org and so can avoid downloading this until its converted as a generic tool

## Release Notes



**Enjoy!**
